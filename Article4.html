        It took over 80 minutes, but eventually Mayo’s Ballinrobe Community School lifted the Paddy Drummond Cup after an enthralling affair in Croke Park.
        </p>
        <p>
        With players dropping like flies from cramp all over the field, Ballinrobe had just enough in the tank to secure the victory. Star forward Conor Heneghan pointed the way with 1-5, while his partner in crime Cathal Slattery posted six points.
        </p>
        <p>
        Both sides gave a good account of themselves, with an impressive array of score-taking lighting up this clash.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ballinrobe led by 1-10 to 1-7 in the 50th minute, but the Tyrone school rallied late on with Pascal Donaghy and Tomas Hoy influential as they forced extra-time.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ballinrobe bagged an unanswered 1-4 during the first-half of extra-time, with Darragh McGovern finding the net, and appeared to be on the path to victory.
        </p>
        <p>
        St Ciaran’s hit the net in the 68th minute through Ciaran Traynor to leave the game in the balance once again, before a couple of Slattery frees saw the Connacht champions home.

        Ballinrobe showed no signs of nerves in the early stages and a well-taken early goal from Conor Heneghan handed them an ideal start. Thomas Conroy kicked two points in quick succession to leave the Mayo side five points up after 12 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
        St Ciaran’s eventually settled and started to pick holes in the Ballinrobe defence.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Ulster champions displayed some fine long-range shooting with Daniel Millar and Pascal Donaghy firing over a brace apiece as St Ciaran’s scored six of the last seven scores to take an 0-7 to 1-3 lead at the break.
        </p>
        <p>
        St Ciaran’s capitalised on some poor defending shortly after the restart as Cormaic Donnelly found the net, but from that point the Connacht champions took control.
